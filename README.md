DeadPixel
=========

A java app, that randomly "kills" a pixel on your screen. 

I was bored and was wondering if I could make an app that seemingly kills a pixel on your screen. This is just a pointless bit of "fun".

If you were more mischevious you could perhaps make this install itself on someones computer and kill a specific pixel. Or even kill pixels randomly during usage.

I noticed it was really memory heavy on Windows which was a bit odd. And then when I copied it across to Linux, it messed up the Run class so I had to re-write it and I think I messed up the calculating of the dimensions compared to how I had it before.
