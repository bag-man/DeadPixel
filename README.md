DeadPixel
=========

A java app, that randomly "kills" a pixel on your screen. 

I was bored and was wondering if I could make an app that seemingly kills a pixel on your screen. 

If you were more mischevious you could perhaps make this install itself on someones computer and kill a specific pixel. Or even kill pixels randomly during usage.

I noticed it was really memory heavy on Windows which was a bit odd.
